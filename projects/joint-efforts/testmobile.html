                <h1>Test Mobile App</h1>
                <p>For the research questions ‘What are ways that we can make the program more engaging to fill in?’
                    and ‘What are ways that we can make the program more appealing to fill in?’ We (Robin and Tessa)
                    were going to test the application. We wanted to test the different pages in the app and how the
                    users react to it.
                    </p>

                                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                                <p>Most test users liked how the app looked, and how easy it was to use. The app seems also be clear
                                    to people that don't have much knowledge on technology, although this should be tested more to
                                    be sure. The rewards system, while fun, wasn't received well by the test users. They don't think it
                                    add much to the application, and they said that they wouldn't use it themselves. One person said
                                    they may use the feature more if it's more connected with healthcare, and it can give fun facts about
                                    healthcare topics. The smileys were received well by all test users, and the feature where the app
                                    shows how the results have been implemented is a very important because it shows the usefulness
                                    of the surveys. This motivates the users to fill in the surveys. Notifications should also be added in a
                                    next iteration to promote further filling out of the surveys</p>
                                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                                <p>This reflection is also in the document, but was written by me.</p>
                                <p>The test went fine overall, but the situation at both the Maxima MC and Catharina was unfortunate.
                                    Both hospitals cancelled (some of) our planned interviews a few minutes before they were supposed
                                    to start, when we were already in the hospital. At Maxima this happened because of illness of the
                                    test users, which is nothing to be done about. The situation at Catharina was less great, as the last
                                    appointment got cancelled because the head nurses no longer wanted to work with us. This was
                                    because of the apparent disconnect between what they expected the test would be (about), and
                                    what the test actually was (about). The hard thing is that Hajar wasn't able to explain to us what she
                                    expected exactly. To try to prevent any miscommunication from our side next time, we will try to
                                    send more information to the hospitals at the start. If the project is still in the starting phase as it
                                    was in November, we will try to update them with new information once it becomes relevant (for
                                    example, once we get information from them about the planning of appointments, if this is much
                                    later than the start of our e-mail exchange).</p>

                    <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
