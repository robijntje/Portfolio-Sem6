                    <p><h1>Personas</h1></p>
                    <p>Tessa & I worked on several personas to visualize several (possible) groups of healthcare workers. Our idea for the personas is to continue updating them through the semester based on data we collect. The first versions are meant as fictional healthcare workers, each with different goals and interests. Based on these personas we can try to find possible issues and solutions for our eventual application, as well as simulate how these different fictional people could use and experience the end product.
                        The personas are connected to the research question ‘ What are ways that we can make the program more engaging to fill in?’, as we are researching how the user engages with our dashboard in various stages, and to find possible negative experiences that can impact the engagement of the user.
                        </p>
                        <h1>General Practitioner</h1>
                        <p>We’ve made this persona of an older GP, in part to illustrate how the experience with our product could be imperfect or how our product could be unclear for certain demographics. This GP is not used to technology, and such already has an adverse reaction to our product and using it in his work. In this example, the GP doesn’t understand how to work with our application. He also doesn’t reach out to customer service, making him feel helpless. This results in him no longer using the application, and discouraging the people around him to use the application.
                            This example shows that we should build in ways to remind the user of our customer support and how to reach it, as well as make sure that older users both can use the application as well as have adequate support available that fits their needs (for example: support through phone and virtual desktop, as they are used to calling by phone and may understand the application better if a support agent shows them how to use it first).
                            </p>

                        <h1>Child doctor</h1>
                        <p>We’ve developed the child doctor as having a more negative and introverted personality. The child doctor wants to progress through her career, and thus works long hours and spends very little time on other things than work. She does have a boyfriend who lives with her, but who still has his own house as the doctor is not sure yet if she wants to make this relationship permanent (as she has little time for her partner). She likes to work with children, and would like to be a mother one day.
The child doctor finds our application via an offline method (poster), but moves over to an online method (website) by using a QR code. Another thing of note is that the child doctor uses live chat, as this fits the persona: she wants to continue with her work as soon as possible, and by using live chat she can focus on her work while getting support (instead of calling or going to her manager, where she has to focus solely on the support).
                            </p>

                        <h1>Neurologist</h1>
                        <p>Paul is a neurologist who is not only focused on helping patients, but on research as well. He is very talkative and enthusiastic at work, and would love to see the care his patients receive to be improved. 
                            This persona and customer journey illustrate a way of connecting to healthcare workers that we hadn’t thought of yet: by having a stand on conventions and conferences. Paul, as a researcher, goes to these events from time to time, so it makes sense for him to get into contact with our product via this way. By having people on events that can also answer some initial questions, we can build an initial sense of trust. By doing this, the healthcare workers may be more likely to try our application.
                            As Paul is a talkative person, he prefers to have a call with a support agent. This builds even more trust in the long run, and may make him a permanent user. 
                            </p>

                        <h1>Nurse</h1>
                        <p>Ilse is our nurse persona. She is very overburdened by the work pressure she experiences from the shortage of nurses. As such, she would like to make her work as efficient as possible. She spends most of her days working, and doesn’t have much time to spend on hobbies or friends.
                            Because she spends most of her time working, she finds our application during her work time. The colleagues refer each other to our application. The nurse checks our website on mobile first, as that’s easy to do doing her work shift. Once she’s home, she checks the website another time on her laptop (as she prefers bigger screens). She asks her manager for help about the application, as this is again convenient during her work. 
                            </p>

                    <p><h1>Reflection</h1></p>
                    <p>When I started working on these personas and customer journey, I didn’t have any data to back them up. This is a result of the slow-moving project and project group, and the amount of time I’ve lost on managing both. As such, these personas are currently based on experiences either I or Tessa has had with several healthcare workers. As we don’t know some of the personal details of these workers, some parts of the personas are improvised based on our personal experience with said person. While this is not optimal, it’s the only option we had at that moment.
                        The main focus for this exercise is not the personas, however. Based on the personas, we’ve made several user journeys. The goal here is to find out how a possible user would find our product, gathers information, uses our product and spread knowledge of the product to other people. With these personas (that are at least based on real life people), we’ve been able to think about and predict this behavior. While, again, I would have liked to have used interviewed people for the personas and by extension the user journeys as this improves the depth of said personas, I do think the current versions are of enough depth to help us in our different development phases. And because our time is very limited (and no test users are supplied by the project), I think it’s our best option.
