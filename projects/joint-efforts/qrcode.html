                    <h1>QR Code Test</h1>
                    <p>We (Robin & Tessa) wanted to test the effectiveness of using QR codes as a way to direct people to a survey, to see if we could use QR codes in our final product as an easy way of going to the surveys that healthcare workers have to fill in. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h1>Background</h1>
                        <p>The Samen aan Z project wants to get insight into healthcare worker retention: a relatively high number of workers choose to no longer work in practical healthcare jobs. This combined with higher demand for healthcare creates a shortage of workers that is increasing and will create more and more problems. 

 

                            This survey has several problems: workers don’t know where to find it, they feel like the survey takes a lot of time to fill in, and they experience technical problems that makes it impossible to fill in the survey (like the internet not allowing the survey to be filled in, or them forgetting their login credentials). With this test, we would like to find a way to tackle the first problem. 
                            </p>
					<br>
                        <h1>Setup</h1>
                        <p>We want to test a few different things: 
                            <ul>

                                <li>Are QR codes being scanned?</li>
            
                                <li>Does the location matter for the number of scans? </li>
            
                                <li>If yes, which locations are more popular? </li>
            
                                <li>Do people answer the survey that will show up after a QR code is scanned? </li>
            
                                <li>Do people feel like they prefer several smaller surveys or one bigger survey? </li>
            
                                </ul><br>
                        
                        To achieve these goals, we've made several QR codes that link to different surveys based on location. There are three different QR codes, as noted below.
                            </p>
					<h1>QR codes table</h1>
                    <p>We've made a QR code that we placed on several tables. We wanted to see how many people would take the time to scan and fill in a QR code in their work environment. The tables are to work on, but people also spend a lot of free time at them and are at the tables for a long period of time. We would like to see if this environment makes people more likely to scan the code. </p>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The QR codes at the tables got scanned a total of 25 times. 7 people that scanned the QR code, also finished filling in the survey. 7 on 25 scans means that 28% of users have filled in the survey. </p>
                    <h1>QR codes bathrooms</h1>
                    <p>We wanted to put the QR codes in the bathroom, because we usually see a lot of ads in the bathrooms. We wanted to see if the QR code would be scanned there as well or just ignored, especially since you need to use a camera in the bathroom to scan it instead of just looking at the ad. We put the QR codes in the bathrooms at the towel dispenser, this way people would likely see it when they had washed their hands and were drying it.  </p>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The code didn't get scanned a lot, especially considering how many people are in the building. It got scanned a total of 6 times, 3 of which were filled in. 2 of the filled-in surveys were found in the male bathroom on the first and second floor. The other filled-out survey was found in the female toilet on the first floor. 3 on 6 scans means that 50% of users have filled in the survey. </p>
                    <h1>QR codes other</h1>
                    <p>We also put up QR codes in places where people would have to wait a lot or a place that you pass a lot, for instance in the elevator, at the coffee machine/table and at the keycard scanner. We wanted to test how often the QR code would be scanned when people go on break or if they pass by a QR code. We wanted to see if people scan it more when you're visually reminded of it when you see it everywhere.  </p>
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>The code once again didn't get scanned a lot, considering how many people would pass or see the QR  codes. The QR codes were scanned a total of 23 times. From the 23 times that it was scanned, only 10 times was the survey filled in. Out of these ten times, the QR code was found in the elevator 5 times and the other 5 were found at the keycard scanner. 10 on 23 scans means that 43% of users have filled in the survey. </p>

                    <h1>Long or short survey</h1>
                    <p>In every survey we had the question ‘Would you rather have 10 short surveys with 5 questions or one long survey with 50 questions?’ with an example of what the question would look like. The example that we used was ‘The questions will be like this: On a scale of 1 to 5, how happy are you with your current work?’. Out of the 21 answers that we got 15 people said that they would prefer the shorter surveys. 15 on 21 answers means that 71% of the users prefers short surveys. </p>

                    <h1>Conclusie</h1>
                    <p>While the QR codes already didn't get scanned that often (a total of 55 times), the retention (or, people that also filled in the survey after scanning the QR code) was low (about 21 people of 55 scans = 38%). We set a goal for ourselves of 50%, meaning that with the result of this test we have not met our goal. This in turn means that we are not going to focus on implementing QR codes on several locations in hospitals. 

                        The QR codes got scanned most at the tables (25 times). The toilets where the least popular location to scan the QR codes (6 times). The QR codes at the keycard scanners and the elevators got scanned a total of 23 times. 
                        
                        On the question ‘Would you rather have 10 short surveys with 5 questions or one long survey with 50 questions?’, the most popular answer given by the people that filled in our survey (a total of 21 people) was that the shorter surveys have the preference (15 people answered this way, which is 71%).  </p>
