                <h1>Ideation and Paper Prototype</h1>
                <p>During the Advanced Media project, we (Tessa and Robin) did several ideation sessions. During these
                    sessions, we came up with several different ideas to make the surveys more engaging and appealing,
                    after Tine told us that the data that the project had collected thus far was incomplete after too many
                    of their test users did not complete the interventions (and thus didn't fill in all of the surveys that the
                    project needed).
                    </p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>We're going to test 6 different versions of the progress tracker, a heart, an IV bag, a plant that
                    grows, just a percentage without an icon, a horizontal progress bar and a round progress bar that
                    fills in a counterclockwise direction. We're also going to test 3 different versions of the reward
                    system, a badge collecting, a card collecting and trading and a plant collecting reward system. With
                    the plant reward we also have two different versions of how the garden would look like.

                    <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
                    <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
                   
                        <h1>Learning outcome 1: User interaction (analysis & advice)</h1>
                        <p>You analyse the user, the interaction, and the user experience, also taking state of the art interactive technologies into account. You select a suitable design process to be able to advise on UX interventions based on a validated UX design.</p>

            <h1>Learning outcome 2: User interaction (execution & validation) </h1>
            <p>You execute and evaluate the user experience of an interactive product. You document the development process for the stakeholders.</p>
