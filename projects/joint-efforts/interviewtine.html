                    <h1>Expert Interview Tine</h1>
                    <p>To get more information regarding our project, and to get clear for ourselves what we should
                        develop, we (Tessa & Robin) arranged an expert interview with Tine Averens. Tine is a lecturer and
                        researcher at the University of Antwerp who works on the Samen aan Z project.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Full document</h1>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>The first trials of the surveys weren't very successful. Users did fill in the first few surveys, but
                        stopped filling them in at some point, giving the researchers too little information for them to create
                        any meaningful conclusions and results. Because of this, Tine would like us to focus on how to
                        engage users more, so that the data gets filled in more often and by more people. To do this, we are
                        allowed to make some changes, as long as we don’t change the questions or the order of the
                        questions within a question block. We are allowed to combine the half-year surveys with the weekly
                        surveys so as not to have a really big survey every half a year, which could discourage users from
                        finishing the survey. This expert interview gave us more freedom to work on different solutions,
                        which was discouraged originally by other members of the project.
                        The goal of the project became much clearer to us after this interview. We now have an idea of what
                        has been achieved previously and how the project would like to move forward and focus on.
                        Additionally, we now understand what our role is in the project and what is expected of us. We have
                        much more freedom than originally thought, and this creates new opportunities to find and develop
                        ways to engage users. Now that we have access to the survey and we have our questions answered,
                        we finally have a clear idea of what this project is about and how we can move forward.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
                        <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
                        <h1>Learning outcome 4: Future-oriented organisation</h1>
                            <p>You carry out a problem analysis and on that basis, you determine the definitive problem and elaborate on this in a project plan.
                            
                            <h1>Learning outcome 7: Goal-oriented interaction </h1>
                            <p>You communicate with different stakeholders and team members about the ICT assignment, taking into account an international context. </p>
