                <h1>Group Ideation</h1>
                <p>Together with my project team, I did an ideation session. I suggested to do this session to come up
                    with possible solutions to our stated main research question and the sub questions. I also suggested
                    this activity to bond as a group, and to try to make my project group more active and engaged by
                    letting everyone be creative and go wild with ideas.
                    </p>

                <h1>Conclusion and Reflection</h1>
                <p>Some of the ideas where very useful, some where not, and some where a bit unhinged. But I think
                    that we did come up with some useful ideas in the end (like the mobile app, website and QR codes). I
                    also think it achieved it’s second goal of activating the group, as everyone except Sarah was very
                    energetic during the session and really tried to come up with ideas, sometimes bouncing off of each
                    other. All in all, I think it was a success.</p>
                
                    <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
                    <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
                   
                        <h1>Learning outcome 1: User interaction (analysis & advice)</h1>
                        <p>You analyse the user, the interaction, and the user experience, also taking state of the art interactive technologies into account. You select a suitable design process to be able to advise on UX interventions based on a validated UX design.</p>
