                    <h1>Dutch Design Week</h1>
                    <p>During the Dutch Design Week, several students from Toronto came to our school to join us for our tour of the DDW. We were joined by one student, Keira. She was from China originally, so she had a lot of experience being in different cultures. During our week together she explained the differences she notices between China, Canada and the Netherlands. The most notable difference was how our cities are, and thus how much more walkable and bikeable they are compared to China and Canada. She also noticed that our traffic lights prioritize people on foot and bike instead of cars.

                    <p><h1>Conclusion & Reflection</h1></p>
                    <p>Spending a week with someone from outside of Europe was very fun and interesting. Keira and I talked quite a bit about the differences between The Netherlands, China and Canada. It was extra interesting for me, as I'm thinking of moving to Canada for a while (among other options). All in all, I think the Dutch Design Week was a really fun experience.
