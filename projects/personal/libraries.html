                    <h1>Animation Library Research</h1>
                    <p>The library that I needed was an animation library. I’d like to add some on-scroll animations, because I think they make a site feel more alive. I’ve generally developed static websites, so I’m in for something new.
                        </p>

                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>Between these three libraries, I prefer Animate.css.
                        Animate on Scroll would work just fine, as it’s easy to use and has all the features that I need. However, Animate.css is about as easy to use and it has built-in features to add your own animations as well. I prefer to work with something that has features that I can add with ease later while doing what I want it to do now, rather than having to change or add libraries later on. 
                        Anime.js is too complicated for what I need on my website. It would be cool to use in a side project where animation is the main point, but for my website it’s too complex.
