                    <h1>Design Pattern Research</h1>
                    <p>For the development of my portfolio and to answer the research question ‘How do I make my portfolio easy to navigate?’, I wanted to see what kind of standardized practices already exist for websites. As such, I researched design patterns and noted down all of the patterns that are or can be relevant for my portfolio. 
                        </p>
                        <h1>Full document</h1>

                    <p><h1>Conclusion</h1></p>
                    <p>I found a lot of relevant design patterns that I can use for my website to make the navigation more comprehensive. I do hope that I still have enough time to implement them though, as the group project is taking up a lot of time. If time gets sparse, I will make a selection of the most important patterns to implement, while also looking at how efficiently I can add the specific patterns. This way I can still implement as much as possible.

                        <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
                        <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
                        <h1>Learning outcome 1: User interaction (analysis & advice)</h1>
                            <p>You analyse the user, the interaction, and the user experience, also taking state of the art interactive technologies into account. You select a suitable design process to be able to advise on UX interventions based on a validated UX design.</p>
