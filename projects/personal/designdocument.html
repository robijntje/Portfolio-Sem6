                <h1>Design Document Personal Project</h1>
                <p>During this semester I developed a portfolio to present my work. This portfolio has to be a website that I didn’t create with a tool (like Weebly, Google Sites or Wix), but that I developed using HTML and CSS. As this is a personal portfolio, I’d like the portfolio to show at least some design elements that have to do with me as a person.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Full document</h1>
                    <embed src="/projects/personal/files/pdf/Design Document.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="1000px">
                
                        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                        <p>I really wanted to put much more time into this project. The group project and the many deliverables that I had to take over from other people made this very hard. We were supposed to have personal project days on Friday, but all Fridays where spent on group project work. While I’m happy with what I’ve accomplished in such a short time, I’d have loved to work more on this project as I wanted to build a completely new website, especially after doing Open Learning for so many semesters. But I guess there’s nothing to do about that now. </p>
                
                    <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
                    <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
                   
                        <h1>Learning outcome 2: User interaction (execution & validation) </h1>
                        <p>You execute and evaluate the user experience of an interactive product. You document the development process for the stakeholders.</p>

                        <h1>Learning outcome 3: Software design and realisation </h1>
                        <p>You create & design software with existing components or libraries using predetermined quality criteria and version control. </p>
                        
           
            <h1>Learning outcome 5: Investigative problem solving</h1>
            <p>You formulate sub-questions pertaining to the primary question and answer these using relevant research methods. You use the conclusions of the sub-questions to justify (design) choices.</p>
