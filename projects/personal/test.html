                    <h1>Project Plan</h1>
                    <p>We started our project by making a project plan with our team. In the project plan we define the project and the research questions, make a planning, and describe the research methods that we're going to use.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Full document</h1>

                    <p><h1>Conclusion & Reflection</h1></p>
                    <p>When we made our project plan originally, we weren't sure what our project was about exactly. Because of this, the document has had several versions before we got to the final version of the document.
                        The research questions did help us with defining what our main focus was this semester. Later in the project I added another sub research question (number 6) as I thought it was a useful addition now that we knew more about the problems that the project is facing.
                        So while we didn't follow the planning because of the group work problems, it did help us with making and executing a plan for the project.
                        </p>
                        <h1>Learning outcomes</h1>
                        <p>This deliverable is evidence for the following learning outcomes:</p>
                        <h1>Learning outcome 4: Future-oriented organisation</h1>
                            <p>You carry out a problem analysis and on that basis, you determine the definitive problem and elaborate on this in a project plan.
                            
                            <h1>Learning outcome 5: Investigative problem solving</h1>
                            <p>You formulate sub-questions pertaining to the primary question and answer these using relevant research methods. You use the conclusions of the sub-questions to justify (design) choices.</p>
